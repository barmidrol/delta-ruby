# delta-ruby

[Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) for Ruby

Supports local files and Amazon S3

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ankane/delta-ruby/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ankane/delta-ruby/actions)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "deltalake-rb"
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
gem install deltalake-rb
```

### Precompiled Gems

This gem provides precompiled binaries for common platforms, which eliminates the need for Rust compilation during installation.

Supported platforms:
- Linux x86_64 (GNU and musl)
- Linux ARM64 (GNU and musl)
- macOS x86_64 (Intel)
- macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- Windows x64

If your platform isn't supported or you prefer to compile from source, the gem will automatically fallback to building the native extension with Rust.

To force compilation from source:
```sh
gem install deltalake-rb --platform=ruby
```

## Getting Started

Write data

```ruby
df = Polars::DataFrame.new({"id" => [1, 2], "value" => [3.0, 4.0]})
DeltaLake.write("./events", df)
```

Load a table

```ruby
dt = DeltaLake::Table.new("./events")
df = dt.to_polars
```

Get a lazy frame

```ruby
lf = dt.to_polars(eager: false)
```

Append rows

```ruby
DeltaLake.write("./events", df, mode: "append")
```

Overwrite a table

```ruby
DeltaLake.write("./events", df, mode: "overwrite")
```

Add a constraint

```ruby
dt.alter.add_constraint({"id_gt_0" => "id > 0"})
```

Drop a constraint

```ruby
dt.alter.drop_constraint("id_gt_0")
```

Delete rows

```ruby
dt.delete("id > 1")
```

Vacuum

```ruby
dt.vacuum(dry_run: false)
```

Perform small file compaction

```ruby
dt.optimize.compact
```

Colocate similar data in the same files

```ruby
dt.optimize.z_order(["category"])
```

Load a previous version of a table

```ruby
dt = DeltaLake::Table.new("./events", version: 1)
# or
dt.load_as_version(1)
```

Get the schema

```ruby
dt.schema
```

Get metadata

```ruby
dt.metadata
```

Get history

```ruby
dt.history
```

## API

This library follows the [Delta Lake Python API](https://delta-io.github.io/delta-rs/) (with a few changes to make it more Ruby-like). You can follow Python tutorials and convert the code to Ruby in many cases. Feel free to open an issue if you run into problems.
